[Concurrency Control Strategy]

1. Connection Pooling
   - We utilize the connection pooling feature provided by the oracledb driver.
   - This allows multiple users to share a reusable set of physical connections, managing resources efficiently and handling concurrent requests.

2. Transaction Management
   - Critical database operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are wrapped in transactions.
   - We ensure that commit is called only after all related operations succeed.
   - If any operation fails, rollback is triggered to maintain data consistency and integrity.

3. Session Management
   - express-session is used to maintain user state across concurrent requests, ensuring that one user's actions do not interfere with another's session data.
